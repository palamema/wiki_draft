## Welcome

This page is meant to introduce you to our community here on Reddit and answer some commonly asked questions regarding both /r/furry and the furry fandom in general.

### Introduction

Welcome to the furry subreddit (aka, /r/furry), Reddit's foremost community for furries!

Perhaps the most core aspect of our subreddit is that we are a **community**, as well as a portal for all things furry. This means that, while we do share lots and lots of furry-related content, our little section of Reddit is also an informal meeting place for furries to chat and get to know one another. To sustain this, moderation on /r/furry is guided by our rules (see sidebar), and committed to the principle that the community should remain a safe and welcoming place.

So come on in and hang out! Don't be afraid to start getting involved right away!

### Rules and Etiquette

The sidebar displays a summarized version of the rules you should know when participating in this sub. Please refer to this sidebar frequently if you are in doubt of what is or isn't allowed.

### FAQ

Below is a list of frequently asked questions: 

#### "What is a furry?"

A furry is a fan of art or literature featuring anthropomorphic animals. Check out [this video](https://youtu.be/xHZ9SwTk2UE) or [this article](http://www.anthrocon.org/about-furry) for more information.

#### "I want to be a furry, what can I do?"

There are no strict requirements you need to meet to be a furry - all you need is an appreciation of anthropomorphic artwork! Once you get past that, you just need to participate with the community.

#### "I see a lot of artists on the sub, can I ask them to draw my character?"

If you see an artist post a thread saying they're taking art requests, feel free to ask for art there! However, it's considered rude if you post a thread asking for art. 

#### "Can I post _____ here?"

If what you want to post isn't banned based on Reddit or /r/furry rules, you are a-ok to post. If you think it may be questionable, please mark as NSFW just in case or message the mods for clarification.

#### "Can I advertise my commissions here?"

Yes! Also, consider checking out /r/furry_catwalk, a subreddit for commission advertisements and requests.
